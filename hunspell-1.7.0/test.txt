No annoying suggestion times any more, especially in languages with
compound word handling and complex morphology. By adding balanced
multi-level time limits, now the guaranteed suggestion time is there
within half a second, not seconds (nor dozen of seconds or more
in extreme cases) for longer misspellings, too.
